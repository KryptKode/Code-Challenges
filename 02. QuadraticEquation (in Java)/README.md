# Quadratic Eqaution solver in Python

This program illustrates object-oriented programmin concept by solving a quadratic equation

## Quick Notes
In algebra, a quadratic equation (from the Latin quadratus for "square") is any equation having the form
	```
		ax^2+bx+c=0
	```
where x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c represent known numbers such that a is not equal to 0. 
If a = 0, then the equation is linear, not quadratic. 
The numbers a, b, and c are the coefficients of the equation, and may be distinguished by calling them, respectively, the quadratic coefficient, the linear coefficient and the constant or free term.
```
	This program gives results for quadratic equations with real roots only...

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need any working version of Java installed on your system


### Installing

A step-by-step guide on how to install Java on Windows is shown in the link below
A similar process goes for those using a mac or linux.

## Procedure to run the program
* Download the two files - QuadraticEquation.java and MainClass.java
* Put them in the same folder
* Follow the procedure in the link above and run the MainClass.java file

```
When the program runs, it asks for the values of a, b, c. Enter the values seperated by SPACES
```
Example: 1 5 6
```
Output:
Enter a, b, c (separated by SPACES) -->1 5 6 
You entered
-->a = 1.0
-->b = 5.0
-->c = 6.0
The roots are -2.0 and -3.0
```
### How it works
* The class QuadraticEquation is defined
* The constructor initializes the variables (a, b, c)
* Getter methods for each of the variables are defined
* The method to calculate the discriminant, D is defined D = (b^2 - 4ac)
* The methods to get the roots of the equation are defined
* In main function, the user is asked to enter values for a, b, c and the roots are evaluated
* **For a more detailed explanation, refer to the comments in the source code**
