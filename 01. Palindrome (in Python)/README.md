# Palindrome in Python

This program has a method returns the longest palindrome that can be gotten from the string passed as its argument

## Quick Notes
	A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar. 
	Sentence-length palindromes may be written when allowances are made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers, such as "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!", "Was it a car or a cat I saw?" or "No 'x' in Nixon".
```
	This program deals with stings without SPACES only...

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need any working version of Python 3 installed on your system


### Installing

A step-by-step guide on how to install Python 3 on Windows is shown in this link
The same process goes using a mac.

```


## Procedure to run the program

* Open Palindrome.py in IDLE by right clicking on it an selecting "Edit with IDLE"
* Run it either by pressing F5 key or by clicking >Run >Run Module on the menu tabs

```
When the program runs, it asks for a string... Enter a string without SPACES in between the letters
```
Example: madameabracadabrapadap
```
Only with this format can the program work correctly
```
### How it works
* The program has two functions (besides the main() method)
* The first function checks if a passed string is a palindrome
* The second function  this function checks the passed string for the possible palindromes
* When the program runs, the user is made to enter the string
* The program then displays the possible palindromes in the string and then highlights the longest
